# virtualization notes

VirtualBox

For just spinning up a VM, VirtualBox is a good choice
- via GUI or command line
- fast
- can control resources on a per VM basis
- well documented

However, we can't do nested virtualization in VB on Windows.

VB is a VM in it's own right. A VM running in VB can't
run a VM

Windows (Hypervisor) --> VB VM --> Linux VM (no KVM) -X-> some other VM 


QEMU

- is an alternative to VB
- all CLI
- smaller than VB
- didn't run XFCE desktop on Kali linux as well as VB did


Hyper-V
- see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/

- is a Windows feature that needs to be turned on
- is nested virtualization supported?
- MS is only supporting it until 2029
- MS have not announced its replacement

For me, it seems like MS is throwing it's support into WSL and Docker


WSL

- WSL is well integrated into Windows. I can launch code.exe and other
  exe's from within the VM and it will launch the app in Windows. I
  guess we could say Windows is the desktop environment for the Linux
  VM
- It does give me a cheap, integrated way to use Linux command line on
  Windows
- my main issue with WSL is that we have to allocate memory and CPUs to
  the whole WSL system. I can't allocated 512Mb to one VM and 2048Mb to 
  another VM. I have to allocated enough to support all the VMs that
  could be running at the same time or for the VM that needs the most.
  For example, I might allocated 4096Mb to WSL, and then run a VM that
  only needs 512MB. WSL is going to reserve 4096Mb
- To run a Linux distro and access it's desktop environment, i need to
  install an X-Server on Windows and access it that way. Where-as, in 
  VB I get the desktop environment.


Docker and Podman

It turns out each of these are VMs in their own right and run containers
within their VM. For example, the Podman VM is referenced at

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lxss

For Podman,

   "Podman Desktop creates a Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2 (WSL 2) virtual machine: the Podman Machine"
   - see https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation/windows-install

Docker and Podman pull from the same registries

Both Docker and Podman delegate(?) their VM to WSL 

Podman says it does everything Docker does - just replace "docker" in the
command with "podman".

Docker is the main game in town. However, my objection to it and, I guess
what i prefer about Podman is that Docker runs a daemon and Podman doesnt.

It seems that Docker and Podman (and their competitors) are really just
the new way of doing virtualization. Instead of VirtualBox or WSL or VMWare,
just use Docker/Podman.
