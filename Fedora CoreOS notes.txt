Fedora CoreOS notes



Getting DNF to work
- "dnf: command not found"
- see https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/1bbx2si/comment/kuc9iq9/
- see https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/os-extensions/
- https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/fedora-coreos-comes-without-dnf-installed/115524

re the os-extensions and fedora-coreos-comes-without-dnf-installed links above, fedora coreos does not come with DNF install. Fedora CoreOS is optimised for containerised workloads. 

Fedora CoreOS keeps itself up to date.

If we wanted Python3, we would use a container instead of installing Python3. 

However, if we really want to or need to install Python3, we would use rpm-ostree,

sudo rpm-ostree install python3
sudo rpm-ostree remove python3
